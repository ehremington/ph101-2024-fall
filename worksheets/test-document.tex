	\section*{Physics Worksheet}
	
	At the end of this worksheet you should be able to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Solve for the momentum of an object.
		\item Apply the conservation of momentum.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A bug is flying east through the air along a road. What is the bug’s momentum?
		
		\item A car is traveling west along this same road. What is the car’s momentum?
		
		\item You want to close a door but you don’t want to get up. Should you throw a ball or a wad of clay? This is a very very wordy problem that has a lot of extra information in it and would not work without knowing the information so it really is necessary and i would like it to all appear without being broken across this page like it currently is. Do you see it happening? It is about to happen right now?
		
		\item An empty wagon is rolling past you. What happens if you drop a heavy bag into it?
	\end{enumerate}
